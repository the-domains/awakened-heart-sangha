## FORMLESS MEDITATION

We call the type of meditation we practice 'formless meditation'. This term is used to distinguish this particular practice of naturalness, which is very deep and simple, from meditation practices using images, imagination, and rituals of various kinds.

We deliberately keep the focus simple. Do not be deceived by the simplicity however. The practice gradually reveals itself to be subtle and profound.

On the eve of his Awakening, the Buddha remembered that as a child he had slipped into natural meditation under the rose-apple tree, and it occurred to him that rather than the effortful practices he had been struggling with for years, he should simply rest with the confident ease with which he had meditated as a child. That is how deep liberating understanding finally arose in him and how he gained Enlightenment.
